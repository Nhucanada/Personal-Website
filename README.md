# Nathan Hu - Personal Website

NOTE: This website isn't currently deployed while I wait for somewhere to host my backend, so you'll have to run it locally 

A full-stack personal portfolio website built with Maven, featuring a React TypeScript frontend with Material-UI and a Spring Boot backend API. This website showcases Nathan Hu's experience as a Computer Science & AI student at McGill University with internship experience at PointClickCare, Intact, and 360insights.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend (UI)
- **React 18** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Material-UI (MUI)** - React component library with custom dark theme implementation
- **React Router** - Client-side routing for single-page application
- **Custom API Hooks** - useProfileData hooks for API consumption with loading/error states
- **ESLint** - Code quality and formatting enforcement with React and TypeScript rules
- **Emotion** - CSS-in-JS library for styling
- **Dark Theme** - Professional dark color scheme with accessibility considerations
- **Jest & React Testing Library** - Comprehensive unit testing

### Backend (API)
- **Spring Boot 2.7** - Java framework for building REST APIs
- **Jackson ObjectMapper** - JSON data processing and profile data management
- **Profile API Architecture** - REST endpoints for experiences, education, projects, personal info, and skills
- **Maven** - Build automation and dependency management
- **JUnit & Mockito** - Unit testing framework
- **JaCoCo** - Code coverage analysis tool (96% instruction coverage)
- **Checkstyle** - Code quality and style enforcement
- **Maven Surefire** - Enhanced test reporting

## Prerequisites

- **Java 11+** - Required for Spring Boot backend
- **Node.js 18.14.0+** - Required for React frontend (specified in ui/pom.xml)
- **npm 9.0.0+** - Package manager for frontend dependencies
- **Maven 3.6+** - Build tool (or use Maven wrapper)

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Run Both Services Together

```bash
# Build and run the entire project
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run -pl api

# In a separate terminal, start the frontend
cd ui
npm install
npm start
```

### Option 2: Run Services Separately

See individual README files in each module:
- [API Documentation](./api/README.md)
- [UI Documentation](./ui/README.md)

## Development

### Building the Project

```bash
# Build all modules
mvn clean install

# Build specific module
mvn clean install -pl api
mvn clean install -pl ui
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run API tests only
mvn test -pl api

# Run frontend tests
cd ui && npm test

# Generate code coverage report
mvn test jacoco:report -pl api

# Run code quality checks
mvn checkstyle:check -pl api

# Run ESLint on frontend
cd ui && npm run lint
```

## Deployment

The project is configured for easy deployment:

- **API**: Builds as a standalone JAR with embedded Tomcat server
- **UI**: Builds static assets that can be served by any web server

## Features

- **Dashboard Homepage** - Widget-based dashboard showcasing all sections with AI development emphasis
- **JSON-based Backend Architecture** - Profile data stored in JSON files with REST API endpoints

- **AI Development** - Comprehensive showcase of AI contributions to this project
- **Contact** - Professional contact information and social media links (API-driven)
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-friendly interface with Material-UI components
- **Interactive Navigation** - Smooth routing between pages with widget-based previews
- **API Error Handling** - Loading states, deployment-agnostic error handling, and empty data scenarios
- **Code Quality Assurance** - ESLint integration with comprehensive React and TypeScript rules
- **AI Contribution Tracking** - Detailed methodology for tracking AI vs human contributions
